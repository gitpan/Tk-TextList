Tk::TextList (version 3.53) 

Tk::TextList is a ROText widget-based implementation of
Tk::Listbox. It is not a replacement, but an alternative
to the Listbox widget. Since it is based on ROTExt, the
widget has extended functionality from that of Listbox.
Justifying elements, or applying different styles to 
individual list elements are examples.

This version (3.53) is a minor update of 3.52, and 3.51,
which was a major overhaul of the widget created by Gred
London, the original Author. Greg gave me permission to
make modifications after I informed him of several bug
fixes I had in mind. Thanks, Greg! Greg's original widget
is available on CPAN and is distributed in the Tk800.02*
packages. I don't know if this version will be installed
in the next distribution or not.

<Version 3.51 Comment>
  I decided to avoid adding major new functionality, and 
  instead, I ended up removing several methods - at least 
  temporarily, so I can gauge the reaction of the community
  and see if they are missed. It was my goal to reduce the
  code base and focus on core functionality, and to ensure
  all Listbox methods functioned as advertised before adding
  more methods.
</Version 3.51 Comment>

No one has informed me of any functionality missed from
Greg's version. Not yet, anyway, but at least some of 
this is probably due to it not getting much use yet, 
so I'm still standing by to restore methods if 
necessary. For now, the following methods remain
deprecated, mostly due to the fact that I felt they 
offered sufficient additional functionality, and
generally cluttered things up. These methods are
easily accomplished by using the base methods of
the Text widget (refer to html docs).

INSTALLATION:

To install, type
 
        $ perl Makefile.PL
        $ make
        $ make test
        $ make install
 
I still haven't finished the POD docs, yet,
and that's mostly because I haven't really 
started them. I have a few other things on
my plate, namely:

- A complete and updated version of a complete
  set of Perl/Tk documentation and tutorial.
  It is my hopes to encode this using the DocBook
  XML DTD, and have a script which will convert
  the docs to POD. This is the idea anyway. It's
  still in it's infancy.

- A slew of other Composite and Derived widgets
  from my private collection. With Documentation
  of course.

Wrapping things, up, I'd like to again take the
opportunity to thank Greg London, for creating
the widget that this grew from. In many ways
it's quite different from the original, but
it's still possible to see similarities here 
and there. Regardless, this probably wouldn't
be finished were it not for Greg's.


Send bug reports, comments and suggestions to 
RobSeegel@aol.com or better yet, post them to the 
ptk mailing list. That's the best place so that others 
can be aware of possible problems, too.

Cheers!
